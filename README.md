# Imarticus-course-page

This was a fun full stack challenge and I would thank Imarticus to giving me this challenge. 
The learning curve in ths challenge was how to store an array of video file on mongodb and retrieving it and passing it to the client.

Most of the objective and feature is dealt with along with the resemblance to the original website.

The challenge is hosted on cyclic.sh but unfortunately cyclic doesn't support videos with audio files and hence i have added videos without sound and some videos with sound.
The videos with sound will most probably show an internal server error from the side of cyclic.

Downloading the project and installing dependencies and running it on localsystem gives the best experience as there is no trouble from either of the file be it with sound or without sound.

One interesting thing here i have provided is the feature to either populate the database and then code (database-first) and other is code first and then populate (code-first).

  *database first approach is pretty straight forward to populate the datas in the database directly and retrieving it for the client.
  *code first approach is provided too by routing through "/init-video" and hence populating the datas to database.
  
The site hosted on cyclic is already populated and hence it need not be populated again with the same datas.



This is the link to lively hosted website : https://dark-rose-pike-slip.cyclic.app/

PS: PLZ try to visit all the videos as some might not been displayed because of cyclic internal error.
